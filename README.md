# PT-field-modeling
Perturbative forward modeling at the field level

---

## Overview

**PT_field** provides JAX implementations for field-level forward modeling based on Lagrangian perturbation theory, with optional redshift-space distortion (RSD) and LyA helper fields. 
It integrates with [`lss_utils`](https://github.com/kazakitsu/lss_utils) for mesh assignment and batched FFT+deconvolution, and with its power-spectrum estimator for binned operations in $(k,\mu)$.

Core ideas:

- Build the LPT displacement from an input linear density field $\delta_L(\mathbf{k})$.
- Construct scalar fields in real space $[1, \delta, \delta^2, {\mathcal{G}_2}, \cdots]$.
- Assign these fields to an Eulerian grid using particleâ€“mesh style advection from the Lagrangian grid.
- Optionally transform to Fourier space and deconvolve the assignment window in one batched call.
- Work per $(k,\mu)$ bin to orthogonalize fields or to combine them into a final modeled field.

## Features

- Minimal dependencies: `numpy`, `jax`, and `lss_utils`

- **LPT-based forward model (`LPT_Forward`)**
  - LPT displacement in real space, with optional **RSD**: $\psi_z \rightarrow \psi_z (1 + f)$.
  - Scalar field builders up to **quadratic** order:  
    $1, \delta, \delta^2, {\mathcal{G}_2}$.
    If `rsd` is enabled, ${\mathcal{G}^{\parallel}_{2}}$.  
    With `lya=True`, also builds $\eta$-related helpers: $\eta^2$, $\delta\,\eta$, $KK^{\parallel}$.

- **Orthogonalization and diagnostics**
  - `orthogonalize(...)`: per $(k,\mu)$ bin Cholesky-based orthonormalization of fields.
  - `compute_corr_2d(...)`: computes $r_{ij}(k)$ matrices in each $\mu$-bin.  
  - `compute_pks_2d(...)`: measures auto power $P_i(k)$ for many fields across $\mu$-bins.
